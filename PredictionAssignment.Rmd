First we need to read traing data into system
```r
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")

```
I took  only columns that are needed for prediction and classification to predict. Assumption is to take only x,z and z values which came from instrumnets that measured them.
```r
head(training)
subTraining <- training[,grep("^gyros|^accel|^magnet|^classe",names(training))]
```

In order to validate model I splited training data into two subsets. One for training and one for validation
```r
inTrain = createDataPartition(training$classe, p = 3/4)[[1]]
subTraining <- training[,grep("^gyros|^accel|^magnet|^classe",names(training))]
subTrain = subTraining [ inTrain,]
subTest = subTraining [-inTrain,]
```

Again only predictors were filtered from sets
```r
subTrainPredictors <- subTrain[,grep("^gyros|^accel|^magnet",names(subTrain))]
subTestPredictors <- subTest[,grep("^gyros|^accel|^magnet",names(subTest))]
```

Model was created using gbm method
```r
library(caret)
set.seed(2131)
myControl <- trainControl(method='cv', number=3, returnResamp='none')
subTest_model <- train(subTrainPredictors, subTrain$classe, method='gbm', trControl=myControl)
subPreds <- predict(object=subTest_model, subTestPredictors)
```

After model was created I did validation on 2nd subset which is test part of traning data
```r
confusionMatrix(subPreds, subTest$classe)
```
Result was 
```
91,27 %
```
which for me was good enough.


I made same model using whole traning set
```r
subTrainingPredictors <- subTraining[,grep("^gyros|^accel|^magnet",names(subTraining))]
finalModel <- train(subTrainingPredictors, subTraining$classe, method='gbm', trControl=myControl)
```

and predicted data based on final model
```r
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
testingPredictors <- testing[,grep("^gyros|^accel|^magnet",names(testing))]
pred <- predict(object=finalModel, testingPredictors)
```


```r
pred
```
results:
```
[1] A A B A A E D B A A B C B A E E A B B B
Levels: A B C D E

```
Which gave 90% accuracy in quiz.
